## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) running locally (default port: 5432)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, to run via container)

---

### 2. Database Configuration

Edit `appsettings.json` in `Ambev.DeveloperEvaluation.WebApi`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=DeveloperEvaluation;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the credentials are correct.

---

### 3. Apply Migrations

From the root of the solution:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet ef database update --project ./src/Ambev.DeveloperEvaluation.ORM --startup-project ./src/Ambev.DeveloperEvaluation.WebApi --context DefaultContext
```

---

### 4. Run the Application Locally

From the `src/Ambev.DeveloperEvaluation.WebApi` folder:

```bash
dotnet run
```

API will run on:

- `https://localhost:5001`
- `http://localhost:5000`

---

## üê≥ Running via Docker

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t ambev-evaluation-api -f src/Ambev.DeveloperEvaluation.WebApi/Dockerfile .
```

### 2. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080 --name ambev-api ambev-evaluation-api
```

API available at `http://localhost:8080`

# Developer Evaluation Project

`READ CAREFULLY`

## Instructions
**The test below will have up to 7 calendar days to be delivered from the date of receipt of this manual.**

- The code must be versioned in a public Github repository and a link must be sent for evaluation once completed
- Upload this template to your repository and start working from it
- Read the instructions carefully and make sure all requirements are being addressed
- The repository must provide instructions on how to configure, execute and test the project
- Documentation and overall organization will also be taken into consideration

## Use Case
**You are a developer on the DeveloperStore team. Now we need to implement the API prototypes.**

As we work with `DDD`, to reference entities from other domains, we use the `External Identities` pattern with denormalization of entity descriptions.

Therefore, you will write an API (complete CRUD) that handles sales records. The API needs to be able to inform:

* Sale number
* Date when the sale was made
* Customer
* Total sale amount
* Branch where the sale was made
* Products
* Quantities
* Unit prices
* Discounts
* Total amount for each item
* Cancelled/Not Cancelled

It's not mandatory, but it would be a differential to build code for publishing events of:
* SaleCreated
* SaleModified
* SaleCancelled
* ItemCancelled

If you write the code, **it's not required** to actually publish to any Message Broker. You can log a message in the application log or however you find most convenient.

### Business Rules

* Purchases above 4 identical items have a 10% discount
* Purchases between 10 and 20 identical items have a 20% discount
* It's not possible to sell above 20 identical items
* Purchases below 4 items cannot have a discount

These business rules define quantity-based discounting tiers and limitations:

1. Discount Tiers:
   - 4+ items: 10% discount
   - 10-20 items: 20% discount

2. Restrictions:
   - Maximum limit: 20 items per product
   - No discounts allowed for quantities below 4 items
